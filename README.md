# Financial Analysis using R

A script that pulls the most recent stock data from the yahoo finance database, and analyses the data via the quantitive rules of value investing. The below Tableau Visualization is a dashboard that allows a user to explore the data. Numbers in red signify that the user should use caution and check why that number is as high as it is. For example, an extrememly low current ratio may signify a chance of default risk, so should use caution when investing. 

This data is pulled on 5/8/2023. This should not be the sole source of investing information, and should be double checked with other sources due the lack of reliability that the yfinance package sometimes displays. This is also not investing advice, which should be discussing with your financial adviser.
